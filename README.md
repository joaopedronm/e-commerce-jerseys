## E-commerce - The Endzone Store üèàüíª

This project is the front-end of a fictitious **American football** jerseys e-commerce.

Here I created 4 pages (Home, Shop, About and Contact) plus an additional one that represents the shopping cart. üõí
Some of these pages are still under development.

I hope you enjoy It! :slightly_smiling_face:
